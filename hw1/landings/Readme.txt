Meteorite Landing data from NASA's Data Portal
Map by Tom Patterson from US National Park Service
Data source: https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh

4 data fields used: Mass, year found, latitude, longitude

The purpose of this visualization is to:

1. Map the locations of meteorite finds over the years 1750-2013, and see if
there is any correlation year found and location discovered. We can also observe
the increasing numbers of meteorites found in recent years as well as more
unique locations due to technological advancements.

2. Map the locations of meteorite landings according to their mass from 0 to
1.01 kg, and see if certain masses of meteorites appear more frequently at
certain locations, and/or if certain masses are more common than others.
